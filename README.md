# Sarvoday-code-fun-do-app
We are looking to build an app that will contain all the medical history of a person. That means, each and every person will have his/her medical history stored in a database, which can be accessed by the Doctors for the easy of treatment with the permission of the user. Also, the medical staff, such as path labs, can upload the appropriate documents and details related to the medical tests conducted.

Our team is building this for India for now. Since Indian government has issued each citizen a unique identity number "AADHAR". We are planning to link the medical history of a person to his/her "AADHAR". We are doing this in such a way that it will be very easy to use and useful for our users at the same time. 

We believe that our idea can make historical changes in medical field and we are looking forward to the third round of Microsoft code-fun-do challenge 2018.
